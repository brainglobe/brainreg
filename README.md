# brainreg

brainreg is an update to 
[brainreg](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/brainreg-python) (itself a port 
of the [original Java software](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11879)) 
to include multiple registration backends, and to support the many atlases 
provided by [bg-atlasapi](https://github.com/brainglobe/bg-atlasapi).
